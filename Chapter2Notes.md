# Chapter-2 Notes

    1. What is NPM ?

       NPM is a node packaged manager, it means it is basically used for managing our packages.
       
    ðŸ’¡ Why we use NPM ?
       Because our **React** app is powered by lot of packages,suppose if we have to minify,for bundling   
       up things, to remove console.log, for image optimization in our app cacheing for that we need  
       lot of helper/packages and those helper packages comes inside npm.

    2. What is Parcel/Webpack ?

       Parcel/Webpack, these are the bundlers. Bundler is a tool which takes our source code and assests and combine
       them into a single bundle that can be loaded by a web browser. The purpose of a bundler is to make it easier to 
       build and deploy web applications by handling tasks such as,

       - Transforming and Optimizing code and assests. For example, a bundler might transpile modern javascript code to <br> be compatible with old browsers, or minify CSS and Javascript file to reduce their size.
