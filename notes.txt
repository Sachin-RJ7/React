🔰❓ Difference between library and Framework.
    🔘 library :-
         It is a collection of helper modules, classes, objects, functions,  pre-written code, etc. 

         Building a library requires less code , so there is better performance and fast load time. 

         Examples are JQuery , React JS , etc. 

    💡Why we need library? 
    The reason being very simple i.e. code reuse, use the code which has already been written by other developers.

    🔘 Framework :-
         It comprises of lot of APIs, compilers, support programs, libraries etc.

         A framework development requires a lot of code that decrease performance and increase the load time.

         Exampls are AngularJS , Spring , NodeJS , etc.

🔰❓ What is CDN? 
    CDN is a Content Delivery Network, which is a system of distributed servers that deliver webpages and other web content to a used based on the geopgraphic locations of the user.

    CDN are the way to improve the performance of a website by reducing the distance between the server and the user and by reducing the load on the origin server.

    💡Why we use it ?
    CDN's are used to improve the performance, availability, security and cost-effectiveness of websites.

🔰❓ Why is React known as React?
    React Js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is often referred to as "React".

    The name "React" is short for "Reactive", which refers to the way that React components are designed to react to changes in data.

    React was designed to be easy to use and to make it possible to build complex user interfaces by breaking them down into smaller, reusable components. It is also designed to be fast, scaleable and easy to maintain, which has contributed to its popularity among developers.

🔰❓ What is crossorigin in script tag?
    The 'crossorigin' attribute was introduced to allow web developers to work around the same origin policy in a controlled way.

    By specifying the 'crossorigin' attribute, web developers can tell the browsers to include the 'origin' header in the request, and can also specify whether or not to send any credentials such as cookies along with the request.

🔰❓ What is diference between React and ReactDOM?
    In short, React is a library for building UI components, and ReactDOM
    is a library that is use to render those components to the DOM. They are commonly used together, but they are distinct libraries with different functions.

    ReactDOM is responsible for updating the DOM to reflect the changes made to a React Component.

🔰❓ What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.
    js files via CDN?  
    The react.development.js file is a version of the React library that is optimized for development. It includes extra warnings and error messages that can help you find problems with your code, and it is generally larger in size than the production version of the library.

    On the other hand, the react.production.js file is a version of the React library that is optimized for production. It has been minified and stripped of unnecessary code, so it is smaller in size and runs more efficiently in the browser. It does not include the extra warnings and error messages that are present in the development version of the library.

🔰❓ What is async and defer?
    The 'async' and 'defer' attributes are used to specify th loading behaviour of external JavaScript scripts.

    They can be added to the '<script>' element to indicate whether or not the script should be loaded asynchronously, and whether or not the script should be executed as soon as it is loaded.

  💡 The script will be loaded asynchronously, and will be executed as 
     soon as it is loaded.

        <script src = "script.js"  async  ></script>
        
  💡 The script will be loaded asynchronously, and will be executed after 
     the page has finished loading.

        <script src = "script.js"  defer  ></script>
